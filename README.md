# Data-Analysis-with-Modelling-and-Predicting-COVID-19-Outbreak
In this project we have performed data analysis, modelling and prediction of Coronavirus spread with the help of various data manipulation and ML techniques. For this, we have taken real-time COVID-19 dataset from John Hopkins university. After sufficient analysis of the data, we have predicted the possible number of confirmed cases in the upcoming days for worldwide and Indiaâ€™s data using ML techniques. 

We have, overall implemented techniques such as data imputation, data segmentation, data visualization integrated with machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this project is to find out a clear and crisp understanding of the trends in various categories of cases and to infer from them the upcoming number of cases in future.

For data visualisation we have implemented :-
1. Time series graphs
2. Pie Charts
3. Daily and Moving Averages, etc

For predicting COVID-19 cases, we have implemented :-
1. SVM
2. Polynomial Regression 
3. Bayesian Ridge Polynomial Regression 
4. Neural Networks
5. SIR Model
6. Random Forest
